		<p>Dear Bae,</p>

		<p class="body">I am going to be super long-winded here. I did my best to not be a total loser on social media (this was not easy). That said, I just could not let an anniversary pass without a long message (don't expect this often though, not my style ;))</p>

		<p class="body">It truly has been quite a two year journey. I cannot believe time has gone by this quickly. I also cannot imagine a life without you in it. It is crazy how things move, and that 2 years ago I was a nervous wreck on the inside, thinking that I would some how screw this all up. While you thought I was so cool, I was not. I played things cool, but I couldn't believe someone so beautiful, intelligent, and compassionate could possibly be into me. I was wrong. Now, we are in love with each other, and even after 2 years, it is still the most exciting thing in my life.</p>

		<p class="body">Well, you are the most exciting thing in my life. Life is going to keep going, but as long as I have you, I always feel it is going to be okay. You have been patient with me beyond belief as I have gotten my life together, and you continue too. While many of my loved one's choose to see negative, you always see my potential. Our potential.</p>

		<p class="body">Our potential is real and it is long term and it is amazing. I never thought in the day of dating apps that it was still possible to know someone was right when you meet them, but then it happened. I know that we will continue to grow together, and to be cliche, I cannot wait to continue to share all of life's goods and bads with you. Together, we can conquer anything.</p>

		<p class="body">Love always and forever,</p>

		<p class="body">Alex</p>
